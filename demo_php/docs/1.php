                      <p>PreflightAPI is a tool for checking the correctness of image files for printing. By using the API, you can check the client files on the printer's website. As a result of the operation of our tool, the client will receive a description of the detected irregularities and a preview of the files - so that he can organoleptically determine whether the file is acceptable or whether it requires corrections by the graphic designer</p>

                      <p>To use our system you must create an account on the site. You will receive a unique APIKEY and APIPASS number. To run the system, use our GitHub repository - there are ready examples of use for many programming languages. The sequence is simple:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Choose the right programming language</li>
                        <li>Overwrite the apikey and apipass values ​​with those received from us</li>
                        <li>
                          <p>implement into your own code</p>                          
                        </li>
						<li>you can start :)</li> 
                      </ol>
                      <p>After registering on the site, your credit account has 500 free units - just for testing.</p>
                      <h3 id="build-tabler-locally">Run on production</h3>
					  <p>We do not distinguish between testing and production environment. At the start you get a pool of free credits - they are just for testing. When the loan pool approaches 100 units, you will be notified by e-mail that you have to buy a package. If you don't do this, the system will not work. </p>
