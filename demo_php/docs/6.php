                      <p>The PreflightAPI service is a paid service - payment is done on a pre-paid basis. To use the service, you must purchase "Credits" units. We settle the service using these units. We only use two values ​​for billing - preflight process and hosting of order files. We do not count processor time, network usage or other values ​​from space. We believe that they are too immeasurable for our clients, and this form of settlement would not be fair.</p>
<h3 id="bugs-and-feature-requests">Settlement of a single preflight</h3>
<p>For example, we'll use the customer's case of performing one preflight process. The client uploads a 5MB file and performs the check. The cost of starting the preflight service is 1 "Credits", the cost of hosting the file (5MB) 0.5 "Credits" - the total cost is 1.5 "Credits" and this number will be deducted from the account value.
However, the client made a mistake, preflight returned errors so the file returned to patches. The client performs the repeat checking process - this time the file weighs 6 MB. The cost of preflight is again 1 "Credits" while the cost of hosting this time is 0.6 "Credits" - total preflight costs 1.6 "Credits"
So serving this particular customer totaled 3.1 "Credits"</p>
